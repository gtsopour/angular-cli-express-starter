# NodeJS Express (server) with Angular CLI (client) Starter 
NodeJS Express (server) with Angular CLI (client) Starter. This starter gives you the opportunity to separate totally your client and server applications ang bring them together for Development (proxy) and Production. Please note that the code in the client just came from the execution `$ ng new client` and the code in the server came from the execution `$ express --view=pug server` (after installing the Express Generator `$ npm install express-generator -g`).

## Development
```bash
$ npm run install:packages
$ npm run start
```

Browse the Application (Client):
```bash
http://localhost:8080/
```

Browse the Server:
```bash
http://localhost:8080/api
http://localhost:8080/api/users
```

The `$ npm run start` execute the following script `concurrently --kill-others \"cd client && ng serve --disable-host-check --proxy-config proxy.conf.json\" \"cd server && nodemon ./bin/www\"`. Please have in mind the client/proxy.conf.json file.

```json
{
  "/api": {
    "target": "http://localhost:3000",
    "secure": false
  }
}
```
Please note that the PORT 3000 is the default NodeJS Express PORT.

## Build (dist)
```bash
$ npm run build
```

## Run Build
```bash
$ cd dist/server
$ PORT=8000 NODE_ENV=production node bin/www
```

Browse the Application (Client/Server):
```bash
http://localhost:8000/
http://localhost:8000/api
http://localhost:8000/api/users
```
